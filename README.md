# EZ_machining
I am new in python and in OOP on the whole(now 2020). I work as a CNС programmer 
and want a flexible tool for editing and verifying CNС programs. 
And it should be free too.
I learned a little bit of Python, Pyqt, numpy and OpenGL. 
I'll do that i can, please help, if you see worth.
